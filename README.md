<p>This page is directed to people who have some intrest in Islam.
It can be a person who wants to know what Islam is. A person who resently have converted. Or maybe someone who has a family member or friend who converted. And wish to understand what this person is beliving.</p> 

<p>As the world have alot of missconseptions about Islam I would sugest to you that best person to ask about Islam is a schoolar if you cant find a schoolar then try to find a practising muslim to ask your questions.</p>

<p>Here I will try to give you short and simple informative page where you can get a litle basic information about Islam. And if one want to indulge in learning more about Islam.

## Header!

<p>On all 3 mages (Islam, Mohammad, Prayrs) the name of the page and e unique image is placed to show the user what page there in. Mecca as a picture representing Islam. The prophets mosque in Medina to represent Mohammad. And muslims prostrating next to the Kaaba to represent Prayers.</p>

<p>On all three mages the background, header and link colors are the same to make the user feel they are on the same homepage.</p>

<p>The black and white header colors are so that the text always is readable</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>When moving the mouse over the navlinks the color changes to indicate where the user might go if they click</p>

## 1. Islam!

### Islams Five Pillars:

   #### Iman - (Shahadah) Testimony of faith:
            The testimony consists of two testimonies:
            1. There is no God worthy of worship accept Allah.
            2. Mohammad is the servent and messenger of Allah.
         
   #### Salat - Five daily Prayers:
            Everymuslim must perform the five daily prayers.
            1. Fajr - morning prayer
            2. Zuhur - midday prayer
            3. Asr - afternoon prayer
            4. Magrib - sunset prayer
            5. Isha - night prayer
          
  #### Saum - Fasting during the month of Ramadan:
            Every able person has to fast during Ramadan month.
            Exept for some exeptions that are excused from fasting.
            The fast is Obligatory on every muslim.
            
  #### Zakat - Paying anually to the needy:
            Every person who has the means has to give Zakat!
            Zakat are calculated from ones savings in a year.
            2.5% of those savings has to go to the poor and needy.
            But if you dont hae anything of value saved for a year you are excused.
            
  #### Hajj - Pilgrimage to Mecca:
            Everyone who has the ability and means has to perform Hajj.
            It is Obligatory for every muslim to go for pilgrimage atleast
            ones in ones life time.
<br>
<br>

<p>Here I have chosen to indicate the titel of the subject Islam with the moon and star that symbolices Islam. And on the diferent pilars I put some icons that symbolices that specific pillar.</p>

   -  Finger as muslim raise there finger as they say the shahada that God is One
   -  The mat symbolising the place where one prays
   -  The forbidden sign to show that you are forbidden things like food, drinks and sexuall  intercorse during certain time of the day
   -  The money symbolises that you give some of your welth to charity
   -  The Kaaba becouse Mecca is the place of pilgrimage
<br>
<br>

## 2. Mohammad (PBUH)!

![Second Page Mohammad](/assets/images/readimage/Mread.png)
[Mohammad](https://miswaq.github.io/islam-for-beginners/mohammad.html)

### The life of the Prophet:

<p>Here is a short story of the Prophet Mohammad (PBUH). It tells about about who belives in him as a prophet. Where he was born and a litle about his childhood, when he lost his parents and who raised him.</p>

<p>I then tell about the revelation. How old he was when it happend. Who brought it to him. That he was awaited by people of the book. Because of the prophecies in there books. The Night Jurney to Aqsa moské in Jerusalem Palastine and to the heavens.</p>

<p>How he is understood by muslim. He is only a human with the gift of prophethood. The dificulties he went through with the boycott and the death of his wife Khadijah (RA) and his Unle Abu Talib.</p>

<p>eport tell about the different battels he faught together with the muslimms. How he won against all ods. And when victories he never became crule to those who used to opress him or show any arrogance.</p>

<p>Mohammad (PBUH) served as administrator, legislator, judge, and commander-in-chief as well as teacher, preacher, and prayer leader of the Muslim community. For the scholars of Islamic law he is the legislator-jurist who defined ritual observance; for the mystic he is the ideal seeker of spiritual perfection; for the philosopher and statesman he is the role model of both a conqueror and a just ruler; for ordinary Muslims, he is a model of God's grace and salvation.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>I devided the text so it becomes easier to read. I only used one sign icon to show that the prophet is the way.</p>
<br>
<br>

## 3. Prayers!

### The five daily Prayers:

<p>The Prayer is one of the most important pillar of Islam.

      Fajr: Morning Prayer! 
      Zuhur: Midday Prayer!
      Asr: Afternoon Prayer!
