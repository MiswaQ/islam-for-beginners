![First Page Islam](/assets/images/readimage/amiresp.png)


<p>This page is directed to people who have some interest in Islam.
It can be a person who wants to know what Islam is. A person who recently have converted. Or maybe someone who has a family member or friend who converted. And wish to understand what this person is believing.</p> 

<p>As the world have a lot of misconceptions about Islam I would suggest to you that best person to ask about Islam is a scholar if you cant find a scholar then try to find a practicing Muslim to ask your questions.</p>

<p>Here I will try to give you short and simple informative page where you can get a little basic information about Islam. And if one want to indulge in learning more about Islam.
One can find a lot of information online both from Muslim and non Muslim researchers.</p>
<br>
<br>

##### Useful site!
* This is a good page to find information about Islam! --> [IslamOnline](https://islamonline.net/en/category/discover-islam/)
<br>

### But here we will focus on 3 parts of Islam.

1. Islam and the five pillars of faith.
2. Mohammed (Pbuh) life summarized.
3. The five daily Prayers
<br>
<br>

## Header!

<p>On all 3 pages (Islam, Mohammad, Prayers) the name of the page and e unique image is placed to show the user what page there in. Mecca as a picture representing Islam. The prophets mosque in Medina to represent Mohammad. And Muslims prostrating next to the Kaaba to represent Prayers.</p>

<p>On all three pages the background, header and link colors are the same to make the user feel they are on the same homepage.</p>

<p>The black and white header colors are so that the text always is readable</p>
<br>
<br>

## Navigation!

<p>The navigation bar is identical on each of the three pages. So that the user easily can move around the page.</p>

<p>When hovering over the navlinks the color changes to indicate where the user might go if they click</p>
<br>
<br>

## 1. Islam!

![First Page Islam](/assets/images/readimage/Iread.png)

### Islam's Five Pillars:

   #### Iman - (Shahadah) Testimony of faith:
            The testimony consists of two testimonies:
            1. There is no God worthy of worship accept Allah.
            2. Mohammad is the servant and messenger of Allah.
         
   #### Salat - Five daily Prayers:
            Every Muslim must perform the five daily prayers.
            1. Fajr - morning prayer
            2. Zuhur - midday prayer
            3. Asr - afternoon prayer
            4. Magrib - sunset prayer
            5. Isha - night prayer
          
  #### Saum - Fasting during the month of Ramadan:
            Every able person has to fast during Ramadan month.
            Except for some exceptions that are excused from fasting.
            The fast is Obligatory on every Muslim.
            
  #### Zakat - Paying annually to the needy:
            Every person who has the means has to give Zakat!
            Zakat are calculated from ones savings in a year.
            2.5% of those savings has to go to the poor and needy.
            But if you don't have anything of value saved for a year you are excused.
            
  #### Hajj - Pilgrimage to Mecca:
            Everyone who has the ability and means has to perform Hajj.
            It is Obligatory for every Muslim to go for pilgrimage at least
            ones in ones life time.
<br>
<br>

<p>Here I have chosen to indicate the title of the subject Islam with the moon and star that symbolizes Islam. And on the different pillars I put some icons that symbolices that specific pillar.</p>

   -  Finger as Muslim raise there finger as they say the shahada that God is One
   -  The mat symbolizing the place where one prays
   -  The forbidden sign to show that you are forbidden things like food, drinks and sexual-intercourse during certain time of the day
   -  The money symbolizes that you give some of your wealth to charity
   -  The Kaaba because Mecca is the place of pilgrimage
<br>
<br>

## 2. Mohammad (PBUH)!

![Second Page Mohammad](/assets/images/readimage/Mread.png)

### The life of the Prophet:

<p>Here is a short story of the Prophet Mohammad (PBUH). It tells about about who believes in him as a prophet. Where he was born and a little about his childhood, when he lost his parents and who raised him, when he got married, when he receaved revelation, what happend after revelation. And so on</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>I divided the text so it becomes easier to read. I only used one sign icon to show that the prophet is the way.</p>
<br>
<br>

## 3. Prayers!

![Third Page Prayers](/assets/images/readimage/Pread.png)

### The five daily Prayers:

<p>The Prayer is one of the most important pillar of Islam.
Here I talk about importance of being ablution (Wudu - Ritual cleanliness). And then give a short explanation what the five daily prayer is.</p>

   ### Five Prayers: ###
   
      Fajr: Morning Prayer! 
      Zuhur: Midday Prayer!
      Asr: Afternoon Prayer!
      Magrib: Sunset Prayer!
      Isha: Night Prayer!
<br>
<br>

<p>I chose to put pictures on the left side for the user to get a feel of when the prayer is during the day</p>

<br>
